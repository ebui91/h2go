              <h2>ABOUT WATER</h2>
              <p>Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is H2O, meaning that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms that are connected by covalent bonds.

              <h2>THE ESSENCE OF LIFE</h2>
              <p>The average human body is comprised of approximately 50 to 65% of water. Water also covers about 70.9% of the Earth's surface. In a year, the average American residence consumes over 100,000 gallons of water. A person can live about a month without food, but only about a week without water. If a human does not absorb enough water dehydration is the result.</p>

I was skeptical at first about the benefits of drinking water out of a bottle instead of out of a faucet, but I have to say, I notice a HUGE difference in how I feel after buying Aquafina. My skin is clearer- my hair is Jaylan-quality fine. I will never go back to tap. <span className='test-quote'>''</span></p>

              <p className='testimonial'><span className='test-quote'>''</span> I consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur when it comes to water. I only drink water with a pH of at least 8.2, so I was thoroughly impressed by the abundant product selection H2GO has to offer. H2GO has been the only website I've found that offers my special Aja water. <span className='test-quote'>''</span></p>
